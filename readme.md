> **A simple python script for streaming anime**

ani-cli-python is a lightweight command-line interface (CLI) tool built in Python for streaming anime episodes. It supports searching, browsing ongoing and completed series, bookmarking, and customizable settings like quality and host URL. No GUI ‚Äì pure terminal magic! üåü

*Note: For icon reference, consider using an anime-themed emoji like üì∫ or üê± in badges, or add a custom SVG icon (e.g., from [Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/search?word=anime) or [Icons8](https://icons8.com/icons/set/anime)) in the repository assets for a modern, colorful look. Style it with dark/light theme compatibility via GitHub's default rendering.*
